    ***chumbley:2010 uses 1d profiles and discusses several different angles of extraction (no alignment necessary, no grooves and no flattening) chubley:2010 is a much more detailed version over David Faden's thesis***
    
    ***chu:2010 describe extracting mean profile of an area of the image after untwisting the image ***
    
    ***bachrach:2002 general description of an automated matching system based on 3D imaging. Uses cross-correlation function for alignment.***
    
    ***vorburger:2011 different uses of the cross-correlation function. One of them aligning profiles***
    
    ***bachrach:2006 67page final report for NIJ grant (for Intelligent Automation Inc.) wear study: "difference between comparing the nth and (n+1)th bullet fired by a barrel as opposed to the nth and (n+100)th bullet fired by a barrel? In other words, does the proximity between firings make a difference? Although some wear effect could be detected in both of these scenarios, these effects do not appear to be significant enough to prevent correct identification"***
    
    ***petraco:2012 I am not sure that this book is the same as the report for the NIJ grant. This is a huge effort, and we should certainly cite it, but there are not a lot of actual results included or comparisons done.***
    
    ***riva:2014 automatic matching system based on 3d images of cartridge cases. Matching involves breech faces, but no striation marks.***
    
    ***xie:2009 first sentence: "Every firearm has individual characteristics that are as unique to it as fingerprints are to human beings." the paper itself doesn't back up any of these claims. very disappointing***
    
    ***leon:2006 first sentence: "Fired bullets bear striation marks that can be thought of as a ‘‘fingerprint’’ left by the firearm." based on multiple 2d images. They extract a 1d 'signature'***
